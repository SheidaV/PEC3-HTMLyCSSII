      As environmental challenges intensify and resources grow scarcer, the circular economy has emerged
      as a transformative approach to sustainable development. Moving beyond the traditional linear “take-make-dispose”
      model, this system emphasizes reuse, repair, recycling, and regenerative design to create closed-loop cycles that
      benefit both the environment and the economy. In this engaging talk, a panel of experts from diverse sectors will
      explore how circular practices are being integrated into industry, policy, and daily life, offering real-world
      case studies, innovative business models, and pathways for systemic change. Attendees will gain actionable
      insights into how circular thinking can drive value creation, resilience, and environmental stewardship across
      scales.
